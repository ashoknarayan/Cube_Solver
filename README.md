# 🧩 Rubik's Cube Solver GUI (2D T-Face Input)

🎨 A Python + Pygame project that lets you **input cube colors**, then solves it using the **Kociemba algorithm** and shows you the solution string (like `U R2 F'...`).

---

## 🚀 Features

- 🟦 Interactive T-shaped cube face layout  
- 🎨 Color palette for assigning facelet colors  
- 🧠 Uses `kociemba` algorithm to solve any valid cube  
- 👆 Simple GUI with a **Solve** button  
- 📄 Clean solution string output like:  



---

## 🛠️ Requirements

- Python 3.10+
- `pygame`
- `kociemba`



## 🖥️ How to Use

1. Run the code
2. Select a color from the top palette 🎨  
3. Click on any non-center tile to assign a color 🧱  
4. When all 54 tiles are filled, click **Solve** 🔍  
5. The raw solution string will appear below 🧠

## 🎯 Color Convention

- **W** = White (Up)
- **Y** = Yellow (Down)
- **R** = Red (Right)
- **O** = Orange (Left)
- **G** = Green (Front)
- **B** = Blue (Back)

---

## 📦 Future Plans

- ✅ Translated move instructions like "Turn right face clockwise"
- ✅ Scrollable instructions window
- ✅ Export as steps or voice commands

---

## 🙌 Made With

- 🐍 Python  
- 🎮 Pygame  
- 🤖 Kociemba's algorithm

## 💡 Tip

Use your real cube and match the colors **exactly as you see them**. The center pieces are fixed (just like in a real cube) so you can’t change them.
